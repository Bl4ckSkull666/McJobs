"Small" ToDo List
- Build in two ways to use Multilanguage. By Mu1ti1ingu41 (for Global Multilanguage) or by McJobs self.
- Add Signs for Join/Leave/Info the Jobs
- Split jobs.yml to single files in jobs folder
- Add support for block and item data , like stone:1
- Add UUIDDatabase or internal UUID Save base
- Change Database support from *.dat to YAML and/or MySQL. Better for changes.

If you have more wishes, please tell it me. I want to look what i can do.
