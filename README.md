# McJobs for 1.14.4

## Description
> You have developed great shops with a shop mod or you use citizens as NPC shopkeepers, you have a repair shop, or you have a block protection system that uses an economy. But that begs the question "How do you pay your players?" Well you could just give them money, but what fun is that? That's where MC Jobs comes in. It's a full fledged player job mod where you choose how much they get paid and for what activities and they can earn money by doing those tasks. It's fully customizable by server admins, but for those of you that just wish to plug and play it has 20 built in jobs that covers about 90% of the blocks and entities in the game.
